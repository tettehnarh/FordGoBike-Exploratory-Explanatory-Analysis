# Ford GoBike Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
## by Leslie Narh

> This is my final project in fulfilment of the ALX-T sponsored Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. 

## Dataset

I chose the Ford GoBike Dataset for this project. This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The original dataset had 183,412 rows/enteries and 16 columns/features. After data wrangling and cleaning of the dataset I had <strong>171,542 rows/enteries</strong> and <strong>7 columns/features</strong> for my analysis.


## Summary of Findings

I observed from my analysis that a lot of people use the service in the mornings at 8am and the evenings at 5pm. From this it is safe to say the service is patronised by typically to commute to and from work. I also observed a strong relationship between the user type and the use of the service as well as the trip duration. 90.87% of the users are subscribers with an average ride time of 10 minutes. 

I discovered from the data that females take longer time to complete their trips as opposed to males. The service was patronised largely by subscribers, indicating either the service offering was attractive as a subscriber or the nature of their livelihood as workers made it paramount to use the service.

From my analysis most of the trips were completed within 4-8 minutes and the Bike Sharing Program was not very popular amongst the users


## Key Insights for Presentation

In my presentation i sought to illustrate the impact of the different user types and gender on the uptake of the service. I also illustrated the time of day and day of the week when most trips happen, as well as the trip duration.
